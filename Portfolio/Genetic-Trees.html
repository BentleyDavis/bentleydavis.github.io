<p>While working for CancerGene Connect I created software to draw family trees.
The display was to follow a subset of specific standards which dictated the look. We also had a tight deadline. The goal was
to improve the current system but we didn't have the time to build all the required functionaity.  found a balance
between Requirements and speed of development.</p>
