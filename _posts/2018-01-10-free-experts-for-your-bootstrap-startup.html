    I will work on your website, write software and give direction and advice on your startup/passion project for free. Well
    for something other than money. Iâ€™ll put in about as many hours as you do on my projects. We are quicker and better at
    things we already know how to do. So, instead of me learning community, marketing, design, and math alone; you help me
    with what you are good at and I will support you with my skills. Here is the idea:
</p>
<p>We select a group of 4 people that include these basic areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Marketing / Community / Writing / Growth</li>
    <li>Design / Graphic Artist</li>
    <li>Technical / Web / IT</li>
    <li>Business / Accounting</li>
</ul>
<p>You meet with one other person each week for three weeks of each month to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Train each other in their area of skill</li>
    <li>Decide how many hour of work to swap and on what tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the fourth week we get together as a group to discuss:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Problems that need solving</li>
    <li>Business Strategy</li>
    <li>Accountability for tasks</li>
</ul>
