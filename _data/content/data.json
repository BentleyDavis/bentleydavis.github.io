He let me take the lead on the project and walked me through parts I was stuck on rather than building it out himself. I would 100% work on a project with him again and would recommend him to anyone who is looking to work with him.\n",

At every turn, he has gone above and beyond my expectations. Bentley works hard, honors his commitments in time and budget, and (most importantly) delivers. I got to know Bentley personally. I found him to be honest, open, and easy to communicate with.\n",
