<p>
  While working for <a href="http://cagene.com" target="_blank">CancerGene Connect</a> I created software to draw family trees.
  The requirement was to follow a subset of specific industry standards which
  dictated the look. We also had a tight deadline. The goal was to improve the
  current system but we didn't have the time to build all the required
  functionaity so I found a balance between Requirements and speed of
  development.
