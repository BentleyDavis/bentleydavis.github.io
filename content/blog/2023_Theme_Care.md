My theme for some portion of 2023 is CARE

Following the (semi) yearly [theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) idea I'm strting off 2023 with the theme of care. Taking care of my Mom will be a big part of my life as she moves in to my home so i can better take care of her in her time of need. I also want to take better care of myself and my partner. This will probably come at the expense of my [Reasonpedia](https://Reasonpedia.com) project although I also enjoy working on that project so part of my self care will be enjoying that. antoher area of care will be my business [Refractive](https://RefractiveStrategy.com). Caring for the business and our customers. My life has been far less stressful since i semi-retired so my focus on stress reduction will be mostly how I interperet the world rather than actual external stress. Mental health is always an important focus area. There are also a lot of health action when you turn 50 so I'll focus on starting this next half century off right.

Best of luck to you in 2023!
