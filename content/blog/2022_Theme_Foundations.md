My theme for the first quarter of 2022 is FOUNDATIONS.

in 2023 I will turn 50. In preperation for this arbritrary round age I've decided to work on getting many aspects of my life into a pattern that will sustain anything I want to do for the rest of my life. My hope is to become more efficient. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. I plan on focusing on Body, Posessions, Finances, Spirit, and Impact. I plan on using [Theme Systems Journal](https://www.themesystem.com/) by Cortex to log my daily themes and track my progress.
