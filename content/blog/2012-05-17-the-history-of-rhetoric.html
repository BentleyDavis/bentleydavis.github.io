<p>I really liked this episode of
    <a href="http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1926.htm" target="_blank">Engines of our Ingenuity about rhetoric</a>.&nbsp; It discussed the history of rhetoric as a skill of persuasion taught by the Sophists in the fifth century BC.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>“Sophist rhetoric was attacked by Plato, who believed in arguments based on logic. To Plato, logical arguments led to truth, a far nobler goal than simply winning an argument.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today most people would agree that you must be good at both discerning the truth and persuading others of it. I believe that there is much more training available on how to persuade than to discern truth. Are we a group of people eloquently persuading others of false truths? I think it’s time to learn from the past and look up some Plato and Aristotle.</p>
<p>Have you received more training in using persuasion or finding truth?</p>
