## Problem
I find myself posting my photo and description on a lot of sites. Same thing for each of my projects. It's time consuming to update it all and even to track where it is all stored. Ideally, I could update it one place and all those sites can come and get it.
## Requirements
- Post my data in one place and all the directories and social media I use can pull it from there
- I should be able to post the raw data to most social media or blogging sites (i.e. not have access to a file server or markup)
- It should be relatively easy for humans to write and read
- It should be easily writen and consumed by code
- I should be able to redirect the URL if I ever wany to move the data
- It should be easily searched for in search engines
