    <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Bentley Davis, my mission is to enable more satsfaction for more people.</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing that mission by experimenting with ways to improve group decisions and
      reducing polarization. My current experiment is <a href="https://Reasonpedia.com">Reasonpedia</a>. A
      resource where you can explore the reasons behind popular and useful arguments and help us find holes in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I make a living by helping you think visually to work brilliantly at
      <a href="https://www.visualthinking.tools/">Refractive Strategy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been creating software for over 30 years, managing teams for over 20 years, and mentoring startups
      for over 5 years. I was chief technology officer of a successful startup exit in genetics.
