                <h2>How can they even think that is true?</h2>
                <p>for over ten years I have been spending a lot of free time researching and exprimenting with ways
                    people can make contentious decisions together. My current expriment is <a
                        href="https://GulliBot.com">Gulli
                        Bot</a>, a character that listens, analyzes and organizes reasons from both sides so everyone
                    can see the whole picture with less effort.</p>
                <h2>I hope it will:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>reduce division</li>
                    <li>reduce the impact of misinformation and disinformation</li>
                    <li>improving decision making by just 1% chould have huge benefits over time</li>
                </ul>
