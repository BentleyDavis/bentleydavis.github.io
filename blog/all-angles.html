<h2>Why I made it</h2>
<p>AllAngles.co was a blog I created about a year ago. I was working through mid life crisis and wondering what I wanted to be when I grew up. Turning 40 will get you thinking. I realized that I wanted to have a positive impact on the world and that one problem that frustrates me is how polarized people seem to be. If I want to really change the world it will require participation of other people. Right now getting people to move on the largest problems is limited by deep divisions. I created all angles as a way to say we need to look at all sides of an issue to really understand each other.<br>

<h2>Why I shut it down</h2>
<p>For a while I was working on my own ideas and I didn’t want to be swayed by others just yet so I could find my identity. When I finally lifted me head and looked around at what others were doing I was amazed by the breath and depth of work that is being done out there. There are dozens of online tools and hundreds of organizations all working on similar problems.</p>
<p>I decided that the world did not need another organization like All Angles even if it was just a blog. I joined the <a href="http://ncdd.org/" target="_blank">National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation (NCDD)</a>. I incorporated all of the posts back into my own blog. There were very few links or views so I didn’t feel it was worth retaining the urls.</p>
<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<p>I did find a niche that I could fill. Although there are a lot of online tools I couldn’t find any that help make decisions the way I do. I think it’s really how everyone makes decisions subconsciously. I have created <a href="http://bentleydavis.com/tag/truth-scale/" target="_blank">Truth Scale</a> as an experiment.</p>
<p>I will also continue to blog about how to debate more productively.</p>
