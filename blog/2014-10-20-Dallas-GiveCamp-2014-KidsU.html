<p>This was the second time I volunteered my time and skills to <a href="http://dallasgivecamp.org/">Dallas Give Camp</a>. It was a great experience and was very rewarding.</p>
<p>This year I had the privilege to work with <a href="http://Kids-U.org">Kids U</a>. Kids U provides high quality after school tutoring summer enrichment programs which positively impact the low-income student’s academic career…producing future productive and contributing citizens to our society.</p>
<p>What an amazing organization. They have a functioning WordPress website. Their challenge was how to track all they they are doing for the children so they can report back to their donors and government agencies. They had 9 spreadsheets spread over 6 sites that required re-keying the data into a usable form which used increased the organizations overhead. Our donation of technology will allow them to server more children and have a larger impact on society over the years to come.</p>
<p>Since most of the developers were familiar with .Net and this website was to be separate from their main website we decided to use ASP.net MVC 5 and MS SQL server. Everleap had donated hosting for the life of the charity which included the website and the SQL server.</p>
<p>We made a site where they could put in their daily data and created excel documents that could generate the reports and format the data to meet the requirements of the government agencies.</p>
