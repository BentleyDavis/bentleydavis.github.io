## Problem
I find myself posting my photo and description on a lot of sites. Same thing for each of my projects. It's time consuming to update it all and even to track where it is all stored. Ideally, I could update it one place and all those sites can come and get it.
## Requirements
I would like to be able to
- Post my data/profile/images in one place and all the directories and social media I use would pull it from there
- I would like to be able to post it even though I may not have access to HTML or Javascript markup
- It should be relatively easy for humans to write and read
- It should be easily writen and consumed by code
- I should be able to redirect the URL if I ever wany to move the data
- It should be easily searched for in search engines
